# Selenium Framework in C#
This framework is created in Selenium and C#. It uses Page Object model design pattern. This project was written with .net core 3.1.

The project is organized into four main folders: 
1. Features - This folder contains the feature files written in Gherkin syntax, which serve as a source of requirements for the tests.
2. Steps - This folder contains the step definitions that match the steps in the feature files and define the actual actions to be performed during the tests.
3. Pages - This folder contains the page objects that represent the elements and functionality of the pages in the web application under test.
4. Helpers - his folder contains utility classes and methods that are used throughout the framework to facilitate test execution and reporting.


This framework was primarily tested on a retail app but can be used on any web application.
